    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        I chose Instagram as the site for my intervention due to its widespread use and the prevalence of issues in the comment section, such as negative and unorganized discussions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The intervention involved introducing a threaded conversation feature. Users could now reply directly to comments, creating organized threads and fostering more meaningful discussions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The effects of the intervention were positive. Users engaged in more focused conversations, and the threaded structure helped diminish negativity in the comment section. The response was largely as expected, with users appreciating the new feature.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I had more time to expand on the intervention, I might consider refining the design and usability of the threaded comments, incorporating user feedback, and potentially expanding the feature to other social media platforms.
